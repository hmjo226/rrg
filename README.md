# Red River Gorge

My Map of the Red River Gorge, Kentucky

## Facts about the Red River Gorge

1. The RRG is home to 3 endangered animals:
    Indiana Bat,
    Virginia Big-eared Bat, and
    Red Cockaded Woodpecker

2. A dam was proposed to be built in the RRG in the 1960's, but the Sierra Club put a stop to it with a protest hike.
