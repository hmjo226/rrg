### Summary information 

What separates the Double Arch from other sandstone arches in the Red River Gorge area? Well, just what the name suggests -- there are two arches all in one single landform! The hike, about 5 miles roundtrip from the trailhead, is unique with its natural beauty, a simple wooden bridge to cross a stream, and a few sets of wooden stairs to get up and down the steep hillsides.

The arch itself is probably no more than 18 feet tall and 30 feet long when you're looking at it from the side. Once on top of the arch, however, it feels as if the arch extends half the length of a football field. Using Avenza Maps to calculate the area of the entire landform, I would estimate it to be no more than 15,000 square feet.

## Final project 

For a super-polished version of final project, you should add content to your two web pages.

The lab 1 [Welcome to the Red River Gorge](../index.html) web page needs to have the following assets added:

* [Base map of popular Red River Gorge arches](basemap/arches.pdf) *(lab 5)*
* A link to the [Explore the arch](#) *(lab 8)* web page


The lab 8 [Explore the arch](#) *(lab 8)* web page needs to have the following assets added:

* [video](https://youtu.be/KNF0ZVhHLkQ) *(lab 7)*
* [Cliffs over 40 feet](elevation/Lab7.jpg) map *(lab 7)*
* Photographs *(lab 5)*
* Summary information/narrative about arch that includes measures of landform, e.g., height, width, etc.
